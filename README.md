# Trademon
trademon.io is a marketplace with social features for trading virtual goods acquired in online games (e.g. Pokemons from Pokemon Go, Magic The Gathering Online cards).

# How does it work?
In the dashboard you find the different supported games, each one with a preview of the highest ranked items.
After selecting a platform you get a list of all the available items for trade. You can browse or search by name for a particular item.
At any moment, you can select an item to see it in detail. The detail view has a ***Trade*** button that initializes the transaction.
The trading system has a video chat feature for arranging the details of the exchange p2p.
